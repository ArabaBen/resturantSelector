# resturantSelector
an introduction python code program

This is an introduction python program named restaurantSelector.py that helps users determine which restaurant will work for different diet needs. The program will ask if a member on your team have any food restrictions such as keto, vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. Then the code will output a list of restaurants that satisfy everyoneâ€™s restrictions.
